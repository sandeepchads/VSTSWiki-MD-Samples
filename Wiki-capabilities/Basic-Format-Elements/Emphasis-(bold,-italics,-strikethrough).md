## Introduction
You can emphasize text by applying bold, italics, or strikethrough to characters: 

- To apply italics: surround the text with an asterisk * or underscore _ 
- To apply bold: surround the text with double asterisks **. 
- To apply strikethrough: surround the text with double tilde characters ~~. 

Combine these elements to apply multiple emphasis to text. 

##### Note:
There is no markdown syntax that supports underlining text. Within a wiki page, you can use the HTML \<u> tag to generate underlined text. For example, \<u>underlined text\</u> will yield <u>underlined text<u>.

## Example:

```
Use _emphasis_ in comments to express **strong** opinions and point out ~~corrections~~ 
**_Bold, italizied text_**  
**~~Bold, strike-through text~~**
```

## Result:
Use _emphasis_ in comments to express **strong** opinions and point out ~~corrections~~ 
**_Bold, italizied text_**  
**~~Bold, strike-through text~~**

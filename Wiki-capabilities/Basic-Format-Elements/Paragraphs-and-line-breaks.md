## Introduction

Make your text easier to read by breaking it up with paragraphs or line breaks. 

In a Markdown file, wiki, or widget, enter two spaces prior to the line break to begin a new paragraph, or enter two line breaks consecutively to begin a new paragraph. 

## Example
```
Add two spaces prior to the end of the line.(space, space)
This adds space in between paragraphs.
```

## Result
Add two spaces prior to the end of the line.  

This adds space in between paragraphs.
